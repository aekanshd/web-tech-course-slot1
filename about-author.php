        <p class="lead">You can't do anything about what doesn't exist. In the end humans settle for what's in front of them. If you think about it, humans who were unable to do that made discoveries or inventions and advanced civilization. Planes were invented because people wanted to fly. Cars and trains came to be because people wanted easier means to move around. However, this came from a limited number of people who had innovative plans and concepts. In other words, geniuses made it all possible. Common folk like us are best off living an ordinary life.</p>

          <h4>About Aekansh Dixit</h4>
          <p>Simplicity is not my cup of tea. Yet the very simple things in nature manage to leave a mark on my memories. Hey there, I'm Aekansh. I will not bother you with all those normal introductions people give. Treating others has to be like how you want to be treated, and the very nature of this life is to give you happiness which we fail to grab. Like you noticed, both the above statements had no basic intentions at all and were completely random. So there it is. I love randomness and crazy ideas. Well basically, anything that is a little Hatke, a.k.a, not normal! Treat me good, and I'll treat you better! Hate me, well keep trying - it'll just not affect me. I believe in productivity of ideas - well because everyone has ideas, yet a only few execute them. You bored? Me too. Bye! :D</p>
          <p>
          Okay, that was pretty boring stuff. If you've made it this far - I'm glad! You sure want to know me better. Well, I'm a passionate author (or maybe a writer, too), I love to code, and probably I want to see myself write and direct a major film one day! Apart from that, I guess I just want to do little things that help change people's lives for the better.</p>

          <p>
            If you’ve been following the news, you should be aware of the recent controversies Facebook has gotten itself into. People all around the world have finally understood the importance of the Privacy Policy documents that we choose to skip each time we’ve been offered a product or service. Just a while back, nobody ever cared about how Facebook showed you personalized ads or didn’t even bother asking how your favorite shoes on Amazon ended up on a random news website. What changed suddenly? Are you just pissed that the wrong man became the president? Or are you actually concerned about how much of your life is exposed?<br><b>Find out <a href="http://bit.ly/ADBdataleak">more on my blog</a></b>.
